                <div class="column1">
                    <p><h3>Gaming</h3> like to play games on pc. I have been doing it since I was 5 years old. My dad used to be a computer engineer,
                    so my brothers and I was introduced to computers at an early age.
                    At the time (around 1997+), I played games like <b>Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem3D, Halflife 1 and Diablo 1.</b>
                    I played these games Mostly because these were the games installed on my brothers computers, and we switched who got to play. 
                    </p>
                    <p> When I was 10 my parents got me my first computer, so that i could join my brother on LAN. 
                    These were small gatherings in the weekends, between my brother and his friends who are 4 years older than me.
                    Today i play a variaty of single and multiplayer games, and its a great way to stay connected with old friends who have moved far away.
                    </p>

                <div class="column2">
                    <p><h3>Piano</h3>I like playing the piano. I am not very good at it, but it is still fun. 
                    I tried to learn from a teacher for a few months, but I prefer to watch/listen and repeat from youtube or midi programs.
                    <p><h3>Cooking</h3>
                    I enjoy cooking from scratch and learning new recipes.</p>
                    <p><h3>Watching TV</h3>Binging tv shows has become one of my favorite things to do.
                    I remember I would go with my family to a shop and rent movies, thankfully, with the emergence of streaming services, it's just a click away.</p>
                    <p>One of my favourite shows is <b>Critical Role</b> and I watch the vods on YouTube. 
                    It's about a couple of voice actors who stream while they play DnD together once a week. Each session lasts 4 hours. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column3">
                    <p><h3>Art</h3>I used to draw all the time and did art classes in upper secondary school. I doodle now and again but haven't drawn in a long time.</p>
                    <p><h3>Table Top</h3>I enjoy playing board games with friends. Back in Norway, some friends and I used to get together every other month,
                    eat good food and play board games while having drinks and snacks.
                    We usually play <b>Betrayal at house on the hill or Gloomhaven.</b></p>
                    <p><h3>Crafting</h3>I like to craft when I get the opportunity.
                    I recently made a dice tower that looks like a haunted house for our board game and also painted the figurines.  </p>
